# Firebase + Netlify Setup Guide for RehCreation

## Part 1: Create Firebase Project (5-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Firebase Account & Project

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Open your browser and go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Sign in with your Google account (or create one if needed)

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click the **"Add project"** button (or **"Create a project"**)
   - Enter project name: `RehCreation` (or any name you prefer)
   - Click **"Continue"**

3. **Google Analytics (Optional)**
   - You'll be asked to enable Google Analytics
   - You can **disable it** for now (toggle it off)
   - Click **"Create project"**
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for project creation
   - Click **"Continue"** when ready

### Step 2: Enable Authentication

1. **Navigate to Authentication**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Authentication"** (shield icon)
   - Click **"Get started"** button

2. **Enable Email/Password Sign-in**
   - Click on the **"Sign-in method"** tab at the top
   - Find **"Email/Password"** in the list
   - Click on it
   - Toggle **"Enable"** to ON (first toggle only, not "Email link")
   - Click **"Save"**

---

### Step 3: Create Firestore Database

1. **Navigate to Firestore**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Firestore Database"** (database icon)
   - Click **"Create database"** button

2. **Set Security Mode**
   - Select **"Start in production mode"** (we'll set proper rules later)
   - Click **"Next"**

3. **Choose Location**
   - Select a location close to your target customers
   - For US: Choose `us-central1` or `us-east1`
   - Click **"Enable"**
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for database creation

4. **Set Firestore Rules (Important!)**
   - Once database is created, click on the **"Rules"** tab at the top
   - Replace the existing rules with this code:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow anyone to read reviews
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Users can only access their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Allow anyone to write to newsletter, but only admins can read
    match /newsletter/{emailId} {
      allow write: if true;
      allow read: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

   - Click **"Publish"** button

---

### Step 4: Get Your Firebase Configuration

1. **Register Your Web App**
   - Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to "Project Overview" in the left sidebar
   - Click **"Project settings"**
   - Scroll down to the section **"Your apps"**
   - Click the **Web icon** `</>` (it looks like `</>` symbol)

2. **Register App**
   - App nickname: `RehCreation Web` (or any name)
   - **DO NOT** check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" (we're using Netlify)
   - Click **"Register app"**

3. **Copy the Configuration Code**
   - You'll see a code snippet that looks like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyB...",
  authDomain: "rehcreation-12345.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "rehcreation-12345",
  storageBucket: "rehcreation-12345.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
};
```

4. **COPY THIS ENTIRE BLOCK** - You'll give this to me in the next step
   - Click **"Continue to console"** when done

---

## Part 2: Give Me The Config Object

### How to Share the Config:

**Option 1: Copy-Paste (Easiest)**
Simply paste the entire `firebaseConfig` object in your next message to me. It should look like:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyB...",
  authDomain: "rehcreation-12345.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "rehcreation-12345",
  storageBucket: "rehcreation-12345.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
};
```

**Note:** The `apiKey` shown here is NOT a secret - it's safe to share publicly. It's meant to identify your Firebase project in the browser.

## Part 3: I'll Update Your Code

Once you give me the config, I will:

1. ✅ Create a new file `js/firebase-config.js` with your config
2. ✅ Add Firebase SDK scripts to `index.html`
3. ✅ Update `js/script.js` to use Firebase instead of localStorage:
   - Replace user authentication with Firebase Auth
   - Replace localStorage reviews with Firestore
   - Add newsletter email collection to Firestore
4. ✅ Add loading states and error handling
5. ✅ Test that everything works

## Part 4: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest for First Time)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   - Sign up or log in (can use GitHub, Google, or email)

2. **Deploy Your Site**
   - On the Netlify dashboard, you'll see **"Add new site"** dropdown
   - Click it and select **"Deploy manually"**
   - Drag your entire `ClothingWebsite` folder into the upload box
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for deployment
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Click **"Domain settings"**
   - Click **"Add custom domain"** if you have one
   - Or click **"Change site name"** to customize the subdomain
     - Example: Change to `rehcreation.netlify.app`

### Option B: Git Deployment (Better for Updates)

1. **Push Code to GitHub**
   - Create a GitHub account if needed: https://github.com
   - Create a new repository called `rehcreation-website`
   - In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd C:\Users\itzra\ClothingWebsite
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Firebase integration"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rehcreation-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - On Netlify dashboard, click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
   - Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
   - Authorize Netlify to access GitHub
   - Select your `rehcreation-website` repository
   - Build settings (leave as default):
     - Build command: (leave empty)
     - Publish directory: (leave empty or put `/`)
   - Click **"Deploy site"**

3. **Automatic Updates**
   - Now whenever you push to GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys
   - To update your site:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your update message"
     git push
     ```

## Part 5: Verify Everything Works

After deployment, test these features:

1. ✅ **Sign Up** - Create a new account
2. ✅ **Login** - Log in with that account
3. ✅ **Review** - Add a review to a product
4. ✅ **Check Different Device** - Open site on phone/tablet, see if review appears
5. ✅ **Newsletter** - Subscribe to newsletter, check Firebase console to see if email was saved

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Firebase not defined" error**
- Make sure Firebase scripts are loading before your script.js
- Check browser console for errors

**"Permission denied" in Firestore**
- Go to Firestore Rules tab
- Make sure you published the rules from Step 3.4

**Can't sign up/login**
- Go to Authentication tab
- Make sure Email/Password is enabled

**Reviews not showing up**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for error messages
- Check Firestore in Firebase Console → see if data is being written

---

## Next Steps After Setup

Once everything works, you can:

1. **View User Data**: Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. **View Reviews**: Firebase Console → Firestore → reviews collection
3. **View Newsletter Emails**: Firebase Console → Firestore → newsletter collection
4. **Monitor Usage**: Firebase Console → Usage tab (see reads/writes)
5. **Set Budget Alerts**: Firebase Console → Set up alerts if you exceed free tier
